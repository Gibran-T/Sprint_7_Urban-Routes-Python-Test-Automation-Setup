python --version

Run the tests (from the project root):
pytest

If pytest is not installed:
pip install pytest

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Fundamentals of automated testing using Pytest

Structure of a minimal QA test project in Python

How to run and write test cases that simulate real interview exercises
